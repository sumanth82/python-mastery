# web-server folder contains html (for information/document), js (for interaction), css (for styling, font)
# web-server simply gives the 3 files to thr browser to display the page - html, js, css

# In the html file you need to add the <link> tag to refer the css file in the website/html display page
#href - says where is the file located

# <link type="text/css" href="style.css">

# To ref a js file in the html file, add it under <body>

# <script>src='script.js'</script>

# Look for the reference files in web-server folder
